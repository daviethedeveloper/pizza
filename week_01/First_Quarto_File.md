# Introduction

Welcome to my Quarto case study for Week 01. In this report, I will be reviewing articles that use data visualizations to answer questions. Below are the links to the articles:

What is unique or good about the visualization? List a few ideas.

  The visualization stands out due to its exceptional qualities. It boasts a well-chosen font that enhances readability, user-friendly interactive buttons, comprehensive visual representation, and a thoughtfully curated color palette, creating a visually appealing and engaging experience for users.

What could be better? Identify at least one issue with the visualization.

  While the visualization excels in various aspects, there is room for improvement. One noticeable issue is the oversized text, which can be distracting. Additionally, the inconsistency in font styles could be streamlined for a more cohesive look. Moreover, the user interface should provide clearer cues for scrolling, as the current flow may confuse users.

  While the visualization has strengths, one area for improvement is its visual aesthetics. It could benefit from a less rigid, boxy appearance for a more dynamic and engaging design. Additionally, exploring a more appealing color palette and maintaining consistency in font size would enhance its overall presentation.
